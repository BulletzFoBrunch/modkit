Community fork of the KTaNE Modkit.

The [original (official) modkit](https://github.com/keeptalkinggame/ktanemodkit) isn't going to receive updates anymore. This is the fork that will be maintained from now on.

Community-made plugins can be installed at the `Keep Talking ModKit > Plugins` menupoint.
